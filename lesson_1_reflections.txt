How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

viewing the earlier version
i realized that it is very difficult to 
find a bug when the no of lines are 
huge ,so we need command line tools 
to compare such files and find the bugs in less time


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
we can find bugs easily
we can share our new projects without disturbing the origional one


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

if vcs is  automatically saved
we can run into compiling error
and also unnecesary log is created
whereas we might forget to save and no backup is also bad
so manual saving has its disadvantage but it helps as we can 
savea after every logical change


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

git treats a collection of files as repository and 
Google Docs considers each file as an individual file


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows different commits to a repo
git diff shows changes in files


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

as i can revert back to previous state of computer what so ever


 Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

version control
